<p>Created by the merger of CSC and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, DXC Technology boasts a long and proud history of innovation, service and value.</p>
<p>In 1959, computer analysts Roy Nutt and Fletcher Jones pooled $100 to form CSC, providing computer manufacturers with complex programs known as assemblers, compilers and operating systems. During the next five decades, CSC grew rapidly to serve governments and enterprises worldwide.</p>
<p>In 1962, Electronic Data Systems was founded in Dallas, Texas, by Ross Perot. EDS, a pioneer in IT outsourcing, grew from Perot’s initial $1,000 investment to a global enterprise that helped 500 million passengers board planes, processed 13 billion credit card transactions and performed 2.4 billion healthcare transactions. Hewlett Packard acquired Electronic Data Systems in 2008, and soon created HP Enterprise Services, focused on transforming enterprises and achieving measurable business outcomes. In November 2015, Hewlett Packard Company split into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and the Enterprise Services business became part of HPE.</p>
<p>Through their histories, both CSC and HPE Enterprise Services were known for evolving to keep pace with the ever-changing world of technology — and for offering customers a fresh perspective built on a rich heritage of innovation and industry-leading services.</p>
<p>Today, DXC helps global companies run their mission critical systems and operations while modernizing IT, optimizing data architectures, and ensuring security and scalability across public, private and hybrid clouds. With around $20 billion in annual revenues and nearly 6,000 customers in more than 70 countries, DXC is uniquely positioned to lead business transformations — creating greater value for customers, partners and shareholders as well as presenting new growth opportunities for its people.</p>
